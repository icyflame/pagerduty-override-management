  This CLI tool can be used to list and delete pagerduty overrides.

  It can also be used to create overrides based on a given pattern.

  For e.g., if you want to create a schedule which has an override for a given user on
  1 week out of every 4 weeks, then it can be done through overrides. PagerDuty does not
  natively support this feature currently.

  Usage:
	pagerduty-override-management [command]

  Available Commands:
	completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
	create      Create overrides in the given schedule
	delete      A brief description of your command
	help        Help about any command
	list        List overrides between the from and to timestamp provided to this command as arguments

  Flags:
	-h, --help     help for pagerduty-override-management
	-t, --toggle   Help message for toggle
